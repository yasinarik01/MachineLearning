This project focuses on the development of a classification model designed to distinguish between authentic and counterfeit instances based on a set of numerical features. The dataset is first visualized and analyzed to gain insights into the underlying distribution of the data. Subsequently, a decision tree algorithm is employed to train the model and evaluate its performance using various classification metrics.
